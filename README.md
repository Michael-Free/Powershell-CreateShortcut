# Powershell-CreateShortcut
Creating Windows shortcuts with Powershell.

This isn't ground breaking - but sometimes I have to create an desktop shortcut for end-users.  Instead of being intrustive, calling them, and getting all this crap setup... I just PS-Remote into the machine and create the Desktop Shortcut without them knowing.
